// Shunting Yard Algorithm
// After the previous attempt at adhering to BODMAS, I realized it broke down with operators with the same precedence, where it should read from left to right. After a considerable amount of searching I discoverd this algorithm [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm), which is a method for parsing arithmetic or logical expressions, taking an infix and outputting a postfix or Reverse Polish Notation. The result can then be sent to a parser to evaluate the equation and provide the answer. The implementation here is for simple calculations and has been implemented using the Pseudo-code as shown in the Wikipedia article.

import { precedenceMap } from './maps.js';

export const convertToPostfix = (equation) => {
	// Filter is used here to catch any erroneous '' entires in the array.
	const filtered = equation.filter((input) => input !== '');

	const output = [];
	const stack = [];

	filtered.forEach((char) => {
		if (char === '+' || char === '-' || char === '*' || char === '/') {
			while (
				stack.length &&
				stack[stack.length - 1] !== '(' &&
				precedenceMap.hasPrecedence(char, stack[stack.length - 1])
			) {
				output.push(stack.pop());
			}
			stack.push(char);
		} else if (char === '(') {
			stack.push(char);
		} else if (char === ')') {
			while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] !== '(') {
				output.push(stack.pop());
			}
			stack.pop();
		} else {
			output.push(char);
		}
	});

	while (stack.length != 0) {
		output.push(stack.pop());
	}
	return output;
};
